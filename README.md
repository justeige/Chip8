# Chip8
Chip8 Emulator in C++

Learning goals:
- Get familiar with emulation
- Practice bit-operations
- Think more in hardware abstraction then code abstraction

Non-goals && distractions:
- Documentation, Chip8 is an already well documented system
- Unit-Tests: Most operations are only 2 lines of code, there isn't much to test. Just find a copy of 'Pong' and see if that runs well enough
- No cross-platform layer / CMake / whatever;
